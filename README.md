Even though we're a quite small team, we try to contribute to open source as much as we can.

Here are some of the things we're playing with:

* Deploy tracker [meta-secretary](https://github.com/trialbee/meta-secretary)
* Simple charts [chartkick](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick) contributors
* Our "[join us](http://opensource.trialbee.com/join)" app ([source code](https://github.com/trialbee/join))
* Stupid assets ledger [assets_ledger](https://github.com/trialbee/assets_ledger)
* Simple ActiveRecord relation counts [association_count](https://github.com/trialbee/association_count)
